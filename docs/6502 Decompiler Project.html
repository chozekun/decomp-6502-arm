<div class="entry">
				<p>Once the SSA stage has completed, we are left with a graph for 
each function that contains only relevant operations, and the decompiler
 has transformed those into as high-level expressions as possible. The 
graph, however, does not have a discernible structure yet: high-level as
 they may be, it merely consists of a bunch of operations that are 
executed one after the other, with an occasional random branch 
&nbsp;into the wilderness. Good enough for a computer, which doesn’t 
really care much about how stuff works, but not so great for human 
beings: to us it still looks like a jumbled mess, although a much more 
concise one than the machine code that we started from.</p>
<h1>Basic Blocks</h1>
<p>When we look at such a graph for a bit, we can tell that some 
statements are different from others, and that difference manifests 
itself in the way they are connected to other statements. Most are 
executed one after the other, meaning they have one specific statement 
they are executed after, and one that comes after them. Some, however, 
create a branch in the graph (such as the aptly named branch 
instructions), while others join two branches. The latter are usually 
the targets of branches or jumps, and they are particularly interesting 
because they provide the decompiler with points at which it can separate
 the code graph into distinct groups, commonly referred to as “basic 
blocks”.</p>
<p>A basic block starts at a statement that has more than one incoming 
edge, ends at the next basic block (or the end of the function), and 
does not contain any internal branches; we can essentially view it as a 
single complex statement. The resulting graph of basic blocks is 
considerably simpler than the code graph, even if it’s every bit as 
jumbled. It does, however, provide us with an excellent starting point 
for the next stage, which finally sheds some light onto the maze of code
 that we have had to deal with so far.</p>
<h1>Structuring</h1>
<p>When looking at a basic block graph, you will notice certain patterns
 that stand out after a while. You will often see a block that has two 
successors, one being itself. Another commonly seen configuration is a 
block that has two different successors, each of which have one 
successor that is identical for both. There are many more of these 
simple patterns, and most of them directly correspond to a high-level 
language control structure. The first example is a post-tested loop (“do
 { … } while ( …)” in C), while the second one is an if/then/else 
construct.</p>
<p>The decompiler seeks out such patterns in the basic block graph and 
consolidates them into what I have termed “advanced blocks”. Once it has
 created an advanced block, it restarts the search until it can no 
longer find any new patterns, making sure that any new simple patterns 
that often emerge after the previous step are themselves incorporated 
into advanced blocks. In the best case, the decompiler will end up with a
 single advanced block (typically a linear sequence) that describes the 
entire function at the highest level.</p>
<p>Unlike most heavy-lifting algorithms implemented in the prototype 
decompiler, this approach to graph structuring is not based on decades 
of research performed by others, but was made up on the fly by yours 
truly. Considering that, I dare say it works surprisingly well. Better 
methods exist, though, and one goal of the decompiler project is to 
implement one of those to cut down on the amount of code that the 
prototype leaves unstructured, as evidenced by the frequent occurrence 
of the&nbsp;<em>goto&nbsp;</em>statement in the decompiled code.</p>
<h1>Code Generation</h1>
<p>At this point, we’re almost done: we have clearly structured 
functions consisting of high-level statements without any useless 
overhead. All that is left to do is to translate the structures into a 
real-life programming language. The decompiler prototype creates C code,
 and that, for the most part, is an extremely straightforward affair: 
Got an if/then advanced block? Write “if”, then the condition, opening 
brace, <em>then</em> block, closing brace, done. Don’t forget the 
boilerplate, declare global and local variables, function headers with 
arguments, close your braces, semicolon your statements, watch your 
operator precedence.</p>
<p>This stage is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent 
transpiration. There are indeed only two things that stand out as 
slightly tricky. One is pre-tested loops with longish headers; you can 
find those in the decompiled code by looking for “while ( … ) { … }” 
loops with overly large conditions containing the comma operator. These 
loops can be made nicer to look at, but it’s really tricky, and I have 
therefore postponed that until later in the project.</p>
<p>The other tricky thing is the tendency of assembly language 
programmers to have their functions return more than one value, while 
the C language only allows a single return value. The decompiler 
resolves this by creating “return structures” on the fly that contain 
the return values and can be legally returned by a C function.</p>
<h1>And That’s It</h1>
<p>I hope these posts could give you a little insight into how the 
decompiler prototype works. There are still many things to do, but none 
of them are black magic. Well, at least to me. Trust me. <img src="6502%20Decompiler%20Project_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>After constructing the machine-code graph, the decompiler translates it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form" target="_blank">Single Static Assignment (SSA) form</a>,
 one function at a time. Function entry points are identified as all 
targets of a JSR instruction, all interrupt handlers, and the program 
entry point(s) specified by the user.</p>
<h1>Translating to SSA form</h1>
<p>Single Static Assignment form, as the name implies, is a 
representation of a program in which the target of each variable is only
 assigned once. In other words, the result of every single operation is 
assigned to a new temporary variable, and the values of variables never 
change. The temporaries are named by adding a sequential index to the 
real-life location they write to. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre>Machine code               SSA</pre>
<pre>LDA #42                    1.  A(1) := 42</pre>
<pre>                           2.  Z(1) := 0</pre>
<pre>                           3.  N(1) := 0</pre>
<pre>AND $1234                  4.  A(2) := A(1) &amp; M0x1234(0)</pre>
<pre>                           5.  Z(2) := A(2) == 0</pre>
<pre>                           6.  N(2) := A(2) &gt;= 128</pre>
<pre>BNE skip                   7.  branch to 11 if Z(2) == 0</pre>
<pre>ORA #23                    8.  A(3) := A(2) | 23</pre>
<pre>                           9.  Z(3) := 0</pre>
<pre>                           10. N(3) := A(3) &gt;= 128</pre>
<pre>skip:</pre>
<pre>                           11. A(4) := phi(A(2), A(3))</pre>
<pre>                           12. Z(4) := phi(Z(2), Z(3))</pre>
<pre>                           13. N(4) := phi(N(2), N(3))</pre>
<pre>RTS                        14. return (A(4), Z(4), N(4))</pre>
<p>Most SSA statements are assignments of the form “x(y) := expression”.
 The part to the left of the assignment operator (“:=”) is called <em>definition</em>
 in SSA parlance; it’s the new SSA variable that is defined in this 
statement. Any existing definition that appears in the expression to the
 right of the assignment operator is called a&nbsp;<em>use</em>.</p>
<p>The definition of each register or memory location that is used (appears on the right side) is the <em>current definition</em>,
 i.e. the last one defined. In statement 4, the current definition of 
the accumulator is A(1), defined in statement 1. This begs the question 
what the current definition is if two branches of the SSA graph combine,
 as happens at the label <em>skip</em>. The inventors of SSA have come up with a really ingenious solution to this:&nbsp;<em>phi functions</em>. The phi function <em>phi(A(2), A(3))</em>
 translates to English as “either A(2) or A(3)”. It may at first seem 
tricky to translate such a vague notion back into a working program, but
 we’ll get to that later. For now, it solves our problem just fine: we 
insert a phi function where two SSA graph branches combine, and it gives
 us a new definition that we can use without having to rack our little 
brains.</p>
<p>While this translation to SSA form does not immediately seem to make 
anything easier for a human reverse-engineer, it is very convenient for 
the decompiler, because it makes many of the tasks that need to be 
performed to achieve a higher-level representation of the code very 
easy.</p>
<h1>SSA Transformations</h1>
<h2>Dead code elimination</h2>
<p>Machine instructions often do many things at a time; in the above example, you can see that the LDA instruction sets the <em>negative</em> and <em>zero</em>
 flags (N and Z). These flags are then immediately reset by the next 
instruction, without ever being used for anything. In practice, most 
flag assignments are never used and merely add a big amount of needless 
complexity to our program that makes it harder to understand.</p>
<p>In SSA form, it is very easy to determine which flags have any 
significance: Each time a flag is set, its value is assigned to a unique
 variable, and we can therefore simply check for each variable if it is 
ever used anywhere. If it isn’t, the entire operation can be thrown out:
 it has no significance in the context of this program. In the example, 
the results of SSA statements 2, 3, and 6 are unused (“dead”), and the 
statements can therefore be eliminated.</p>
<p>This approach is not limited to flags, it works with any operation 
that does not have side effects (such as I/O operations do). Programs 
that try to hide their meaning by performing a bunch of confusing, but 
ultimately pointless operations benefit enormously from dead-code 
elimination. (This, as a side note, makes it a bit tricky to generate 
test cases, which are the quintessence of pointless code after all.)</p>
<h2>Expression propagation</h2>
<p>In machine code it is often difficult to determine what part an 
individual instruction plays in the bigger scheme of things. Expression 
propagation helps here by combining (and then simplifying) individual 
operations into high-level expressions. In the example, it is possible 
to propagate the definition of A(1) into statement 4, transforming it to</p>
<pre>4. A(2) := 42 &amp; M0x1234(0)</pre>
<p>In itself, this is not very helpful, but if you have a keen eye you 
will have noticed that we have just replaced the only use of A(1) with a
 constant. A(1) is now no longer used and can be eliminated. The 
decompiler always performs a DCE pass after expression propagation to 
sweep up these now-dead definitions.</p>
<h2>Pruning dead branches</h2>
<p>After expression propagation, it sometimes turns out that what looks 
like a conditional branch actually depends on a fixed value and is 
therefore really an unconditional branch (or, much more rarely, a NOP). 
In such cases, the decompiler will cut off (prune) one of the branches 
completely.</p>
<h1>Identifying arguments and return values</h1>
<p>Assembler code can not be expected to follow any conventions when it 
comes to interfaces between functions, making it vital to be able to 
logically determine which arguments a function takes and how it returns 
its results, if any.</p>
<p>Fortunately, determining arguments is trivial in SSA form. When a 
location (a register or a piece of memory) is used in machine code, it 
will be represented in SSA form as the most recent definition of the 
given location; looking at SSA statement 4, you can see that the 
operands of the “logical and” operation are the accumulator and the 
memory location 0x1234. The current definition of the accumulator at 
that point is A(1), defined in statement 1. Memory at 0x1234, however, 
has not been defined in this function yet, and is therefore given the 
index 0. A function’s parameters are all the variables with index 0, 
i.e. all locations that are used before being defined.</p>
<p>Finding a function’s return values is slightly more tricky. In the 
current implementation of the decompiler, it is achieved in two steps: 
First, the decompiler assumes the entirety of all definitions of a 
function to be return values. Once it has decompiled the entire program,
 it will check which of these definitions are actually used by callers; 
these are the real return values of the function.&nbsp;The current 
implementation has trouble identifying the return values correctly in 
the presence of recursion, but solutions for this problem exist and 
merely have to be implemented.</p>
<h1>Translating back from SSA form</h1>
<p>Now that we have doctored our SSA graph sufficiently, it may look like this:</p>
<pre>4.  A(2) := 42 &amp; M0x1234(0)</pre>
<pre>7.  branch to 11 if A(2) != 0</pre>
<pre>8.  A(3) := A(2) | 23</pre>
<pre>11. A(4) := phi(A(2), A(3))</pre>
<pre>14. return (A(4))</pre>
<p>Our intention is to translate this back into real, working code, and 
most programming languages are not sufficiently advanced to accommodate 
the “dunno, either this or that” semantics of SSA’s phi functions. Also,
 we don’t want masses of temporary variables in our generated code. The 
approach the decompiler currently takes is this: First, find all places 
where a non-current definition is used, and create a copy of this 
definition. Second, remove all indices. Third, remove all phi functions.
 Our example then looks like this:</p>
<pre>4. A := 42 &amp; M0x1234</pre>
<pre>7. branch to 11 if A != 0</pre>
<pre>8. A := A | 23</pre>
<pre>14. return (A)</pre>
<p>The currently used algorithm is rather naive, and it occasionally 
creates copies of definitions where they are not actually necessary. 
Translation out of SSA form is a very well researched subject, and there
 are much more advanced methods available.</p>
<p>The now de-SSAified graphs are already much simpler than the 
corresponding parts of the machine-code graph because they are not 
constrained by the limitations of the CPU instruction set. Apart from 
pruned branches and eliminated code, however, they are every bit as 
chaotic as the original. The next task for our decompiler is to create 
order from chaos and find us the large-scale structure of our program. 
More on that in the next installment.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Decompilation is all about graphs, and the way the decompiler works 
its magic is largely by creating and transforming a large number of 
them:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>machine-code graph</strong>: This graph represents the control flow, one machine instruction at a time, and covers the entire program.</li>
<li>The <strong>SSA graphs</strong>: SSA (<strong>S</strong>tatic <strong>S</strong>ingle <strong>A</strong>ssignment)
 is the so-called “intermediate representation” of the decompiler. The 
machine-code graph is translated to SSA form one function at a time. The
 SSA form has properties that make it very easy to eliminate unnecessary
 detail and to determine function interfaces and variable scopes. It 
also allows the decompiler to easily combine simple operations into 
complex expressions, which is vital when the goal is to create code that
 is well-suited for human consumption.</li>
<li>The <strong>block graphs</strong>: After the decompiler is done 
mangling the SSA graphs, it translates them out of SSA form and combines
 them into so-called “basic blocks”, which are essentially simple 
sequences of operations that have a single entry point. The decompiler 
then composes higher-level structures from these blocks, such as loops 
or if/then/else blocks, ending up with a much simpler graph that is very
 straightforward to translate to C functions.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Constructing the machine-code graph</h1>
<p>The machine-code graph represents the way the processor steps through
 each individual instruction. The decompiler starts at one or more entry
 points and from there on only cares about one thing: Where is the next 
instruction? What each instruction actually does is largely irrelevant 
at this stage, but the instruction itself is saved for reference. 
Eventually we end up with a big and rather chaotic graph with a lot of 
loops and branches and dead ends (such as returns) that represents the 
entire executable part of the program. Well, almost.</p>
<h2>The tricky bits</h2>
<p>In some cases we run into an indirect jump, which is often used to 
implement n-way switches. Where an indirect jump goes to depends on the 
contents of memory at the time it is executed. We have no easy way to 
tell what those contents would be at this point, so for now we consider 
it a dead end, even though execution will actually continue at at least 
one other point, probably more than one. Since we don’t know what these 
points are, we cannot add them to the machine-code graph, which 
therefore remains incomplete. A similar problem can occur with 
self-modifying code, which may fool us into creating a wrong or 
incomplete machine-code graph. These issues are ignored in the prototype
 for the sake of simplicity. To deal with them adequately, it will be 
necessary to determine the values the indirect jump target or modified 
code can have (“range analysis”). This is easier than it sounds because 
in most cases, they will only take on a couple of discrete values, such 
as function addresses or valid opcodes, and will not be the result of 
complex operations that might be difficult to figure out. (Note that 
cases of self-modifying code in which only operands are modified can be 
replaced with a higher-level operation without having to do range 
analysis.)</p>
<p>These somewhat tricky cases notwithstanding, the machine-code graph 
is rather static: once it has been constructed, not much will be changed
 about it. It largely serves as reference for the next and considerably 
more dynamic stage: SSA. More on that in the next installment.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>Alright, so the campaign is public now, and I’m slowly recovering
 from being the nervous wreck I became five minutes after I pressed the 
“Go Live” button. The whole project has so far been met with a lot of 
enthusiasm, a couple of amusing anecdotes, and a really large amount of 
skepticism. Decompilation still seems to have an air of witchcraft to 
many people.</p>
<p>I’m planning to post a write-up of how the <a href="http://6502.emulinks.de/">decompiler prototype</a>
 works here, in the hope that this will convert a few non-believers. For
 those that need no conversion, I’d like to ask you to go forth and tell
 a few people about it, because I won’t be able to do all this on <a href="http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_joe_decuir.html" target="_blank">Joe Decuir</a>‘s contribution alone. <img src="6502%20Decompiler%20Project_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"></p>
